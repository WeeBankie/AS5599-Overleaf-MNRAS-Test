%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
The abstract should briefly describe the aims, methods, and main results of the paper.
It should be a single paragraph not more than 250 words (200 words for Letters).
No references should appear in the abstract.

I am hopeful that the project list will be available soon, then I can go to work on it. Maybe this paper will be accepted!
\end{abstract}

% Select between one and six entries from the list of approved keywords.
% Don't make up new ones.

keyword1 beauty -- keyword2 charm -- keyword3 garbage
\end{keywords}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%   TOC   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The MNRAS class isn't designed to include a table of contents, but for this document one is useful.

%-------------- INTRODUCTION -----------------------------

\section{Introduction}
This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide. All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field and describes the problem the authors aim to solve.

We would also like to mention the good work done by Einstein \citep{Einstein} and Dirac \citep{Dirac}. Recent research into dark energy has been performed using HST observations \citep{suzuki2012hubble}. An interesting piece on the determination of H0 from Cepheids is provided by \citet{2006ApJ...652.1133M}.

There are a thousand researchers working on BBH mergers \citep{PhysRevLett.119.141101} at LIGO.

Regarding the possibility of using quasars as standard candles \citet{2018arXiv181102590R} suggest that supernovae data may mislead the conclusion that the expansion of the universe is presently accelerating.

An overview of the SDSS MaNGA project is provided by \citet{Bundy_2014}. A concise description of the \href{https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-637X/798/1/7/meta#apj504473s3}{survey design} is included in Section 3. \citet{2008MNRAS.388.1321P} have analysed the distribution of galaxy shapes in the SDSS DR6. The shapes of high-redshift galaxies has been investigated by \citet{2012ApJ...754L..24C}.

Reverberation mapping of active galactic nuclei is discussed in \citet{2017ApJ...840...97F}.

We have now setup synchronising with GitHub and are testing to see that this works OK.

\section{Methods, Observations, Simulations etc.}
Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used.
It is frequently split into subsections, such as Section~\ref{sec:maths} below.
\subsection{Maths}
\label{sec:maths} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere
Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
as a numbered equation:
    \begin{equation}
        x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
    	\label{eq:quadratic}
    \end{equation}
Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}). 

Note that this equation can appear centred using 
\verb'ceqn' or left-aligned using \verb'fleqn' in the \verb'\documentclass[]{}' statement.

\subsubsection{Hard sums}
Here we will attempt some difficult mathematics including:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Vector calculus
\item Partial differential equations
\item Taylor expansions
\item Times tables
\item One-two, miss a few.., 99, 100!
\end{enumerate}
\[\]

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't worry about the\textbf{ exact layout}, which will be handled by the publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:CMD1_figure}, and tables as
e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.


% Example table
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
	\label{tab:example_table}
	\begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
		\hline
		A & B & C & D\\
		\hline
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
		2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
		3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

%======== Jeans Dynamical Modelling =========

\section{Jeans dynamical modelling}
\label{sec:Jeans}

Dynamical modelling of galaxies can be performed using the Jeans \citep{Cappellari2008} or Schwarzschild modelling methods.

%=================== ANALYSIS ==============

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

A Bayesian analysis and model fit was performed on the data according to Section ZZ of \citet{hilbe_de-souza_ishida_2017}. Usefull Python code and visualisation examples can be found in \citet{2014sdmm.book.....I}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% RESULTS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}


I have calculated a flux of 2.567 \fluxdensity.

The Sombrero galaxy lies at a distance of 10 \Mpc. It has a luminosity of about $10^{11}$ \Lsun, therefore having a mass of around $10^{11}$ \Msun.


Many other interesting results were obtained as reported in Table \ref{tab:resultstable}.

An additional finding was that the speed of light was determined to be approximately $c=3.10^8$ \ms.


% \begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}
 \centering
 \caption{Stellar masses and luminosities.}
  \label{tab:resultstable}
 \begin{tabular}{lcc}
  \hline
  Star & Mass & Luminosity\\
   & $M_{\sun}$ & $L_{\sun}$\\
  \hline
  Sun & 1.00 & 1.00\\
  $\alpha$~Cen~A & 1.10 & 1.52\\
  $\epsilon$~Eri & 0.82 & 0.34\\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{table}
% \end{verbatim}

\section{Galaxy CMDs}
\label{sec:CMDs}
Here are a couple of plots of galaxy colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD) showing the bimodal distribution between the 'blue cloud' and 'red sequence' regions of the galaxy CMD.
We will need to use the 'here' command to enforce placement or maybe use 'placeins' to constrain the plot within the parent section.

Figure \ref{fig:CMD1_figure} shows the $u-g$ colour plotted against $M_g$ magnitude for 20,000 nearby galaxies ($z < 0.04$).

% CMD figures
\begin{figure} %{h}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{galaxyCMD2}
    \caption{Galaxy colour-magnitude diagram: $u-r$ colour index versus $M_r$ magnitude. The bimodality of the distribution is discussed in the text.}
    \label{fig:CMD2_figure}
\end{figure}

An interesting treatment of galaxy CMDs is described in \citet{2012MNRAS.419.1727C}. This document is published by MNRAS and so is a good reference for proper formatting.
A lot of stars are included in the catalogue by \citet{hog2000tycho}.

	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex

    \label{fig:CMD1_figure}
\end{figure}

\section{Post-starburst Galaxies (PSB)}
Vivienne has been involved in the preparation of a paper \citep{017MNRAS.472.1401A} regarding the relationship between quenching of star formation and morphological transition.

\section{Further work}
Based on the inconclusive results reported in Table \ref{tab:resultstable}, together with the very poor conclusions arrived at in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}, we need to do lots more work. One facet is the ability to cut and paste running text from other sources, e.g. MS Word, which should be straightforward.
In particular we need a full-width table: here is an example.

\defcitealias{smith2014}{Paper~I}

\begin{table*}
 \caption{Common citation commands, provided by the \texttt{natbib} package.}
 \label{tab:natbib}
 \begin{tabular}{lll}
  \hline
  Command & Output & Note\\
  \hline
  \verb'\citet{key}' & \citet{smith2014} & \\
  \verb'\citep{key}' & \citep{smith2014} & \\
  \verb'\citep{key,key2}' & \citep{smith2014,jones2015} & Multiple papers\\
  \verb'\citet[table 4]{key}' & \citet[table 4]{smith2014} & \\
  \verb'\citep[see][figure 7]{key}' & \citep[see][figure 7]{smith2014} & \\
  \verb'\citealt{key}' & \citealt{smith2014} & For use with manual brackets\\
  \verb'\citeauthor{key}' & \citeauthor{smith2014} & If already cited in close proximity\\
  \verb'\defcitealias{key}{Paper~I}' &  & Define an alias (doesn't work in floats)\\
  \verb'\citetalias{key}' & \citetalias{smith2014} & \\
  \verb'\citepalias{key}' & \citepalias{smith2014} & \\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Well, that was easy: it appears that the following construct does the trick...

\begin{table*}
 \caption{Common citation commands, provided by the  \texttt{natbib} package.}
 \begin{tabular}{lll}
 \hline
 Subject & Verb & Object \\
 \hline
    I & wandered & lonely as a cloud \\
 \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{table*}


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.
