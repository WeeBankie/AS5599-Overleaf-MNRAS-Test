% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
The abstract should briefly describe the aims, methods, and main results of the paper.
It should be a single paragraph not more than 250 words (200 words for Letters).
No references should appear in the abstract.

Maybe this paper will be accepted!

\section{Introduction}

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide.

All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field and describes the problem the authors aim to solve.

We would also like to mention the good work done by Einstein \citep{Einstein} and Dirac \citep{Dirac}. Recent research into dark energy has been performed using HST observations \citep{suzuki2012hubble}. An interesting piece on the determination of H0 from Cepheids is provided by \citet{2006ApJ...652.1133M}.
There are a thousand researchers working on BBH mergers \citep{PhysRevLett.119.141101} at LIGO.

Regarding the possibility of using quasars as standard candles \citet{2018arXiv181102590R} suggest that supernovae data may mislead the conclusion that the expansion of the universe is presently accelerating.

We have now setup synchronising with GitHub and are testing to see that this works OK.
\section{Methods, Observations, Simulations etc.}
Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used.
It is frequently split into subsections, such as Section~\ref{sec:maths} below.
\subsection{Maths}
\label{sec:maths} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere
Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
as a numbered equation:
    \begin{equation}
        x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
    	\label{eq:quadratic}
    \end{equation}
Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}).
\subsubsection{Hard sums}
Here we will attempt some difficult mathematics including:

\begin{enumerate}
\item vector calculus
\item partial differential equations
\item Taylor expansions
\item times tables
\item one-two, miss a few, 99...100!

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.

% Example figure
\begin{figure}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
    \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
	Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
	but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
    \label{fig:example_figure}
\end{figure}

% Example table
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
	\label{tab:example_table}
	\begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
		\hline
		A & B & C & D\\
		\hline
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
		2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
		3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% RESULTS TABLE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Many interesting results were obtained as reported in Table \ref{tab:resultstable}:


% \begin{verbatim}
\begin{table}
 \centering
 \caption{Stellar masses and luminosities.}
  \label{tab:resultstable}
 \begin{tabular}{lcc}
  \hline
  Star & Mass & Luminosity\\
   & $M_{\sun}$ & $L_{\sun}$\\
  \hline
  Sun & 1.00 & 1.00\\
  $\alpha$~Cen~A & 1.10 & 1.52\\
  $\epsilon$~Eri & 0.82 & 0.34\\
  \hline
 \end{tabular}
\end{table}
% \end{verbatim}

\section{Galaxy CMDs}
\label{sec:CMDs}
Here are a couple of plots of galaxy colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD) showing the bimodal distribution between the 'blue cloud' and 'red sequence regions of the galaxy CMD.
We will need to use the 'here' command to enforce placement or maybe use 'placeins' to constrain the plot within the parent section.

Figure \ref{fig:CMD1_figure} shows the $u-g$ colour plotted against $M_g$ magnitude for 20,000 nearby galaxies ($z < 0.04$).

% CMD figures
\begin{figure} %{h}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{galaxyCMD}
%	\includegraphics[width=6 cm]{galaxyCMD}
    \caption{Galaxy colour-magnitude diagram: $u-g$ colour index versus $M_g$ magnitude. The bimodality of the distribution is discussed in the text.}
    \label{fig:CMD1_figure}
\end{figure}


%%%%%%%%%%%%% Further work %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Further work}
Based on the inconclusive results reported in Table \ref{tab:resultstable}, together with the very poor conclusions arrived at in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}, we need to do lots more work.

%%%%%%%%%%%%% Conclusions %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Acknowledgements %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{Acknowledgements}

The Acknowledgements section is not numbered. Here you can thank helpful
colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc. Try to keep it short.

it can be placed in an Appendix which appears after the list of references.
